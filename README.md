# Description
This is one of my first team frontend projects. Behold Airbnb Optimizer. Using a predictive model, Airbnb Optimizer will predict the best price for your Berlin rental based on historical rental data. 

# Techstack
React, Context API, Sass, HTML

# Structure
 1. Login
 2. Registry
 3. Dashboard
 4. About page(external page made by fellow teammate)

# Improvements/bugs
There are many improvements that could be made.
1. Form validation needs an overhaul. We aren't offering users enough information especially when the user recieves errors from the backend. 
2. Images are too large. We should resize and load them differently. 

# Features to add
1. Adding a map of where your rentals are could give users much more data about their rental properties. 
2. Allowing users to enter a custom price would be more beneficial than just assuming they will use the optimized price. 
3. Flesh out users dashboard and allow users to add custom photos. 

# How to use
1. Register/sign in
2. Add properties 
3. Properties update in dashboard with optimized price from price optimizer.
